# Junior Back-end Software Engineer ASSESSMENT

### Welcome

The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the skills required to successfully carry out a part of the responsibilities of the Junior Back-end Software Engineer role at Alma Economics. You have five days to deliver the project below.

### Python Movie Manager System

This assessment evaluates your Python programming proficiency, focusing on file manipulation and basic data handling. You will work with a list of movies stored in a CSV file, which you can find [here](https://github.com/almaeconomics/movies_database). Your tasks will involve reading from and writing to files, manipulating data, and performing more complex operations on the movie information.

### Task 1 - Data Loading

- Write a Python script to read the contents of the CSV file that contains the movies and load the movie data into an appropriate data structure.
- Display the total number of movies in the CSV file.

### Task 2 - Advanced Manipulation

- Implement a function to calculate and display the average score of all movies in the data structure.
- Create a function to find and display the top N movies with the highest score.

### Task 3 - Data Operations

- Implement a function to filter and display movies based on a specified genre.
- Create a function to find and display all unique genres in the movie data.

### Task 4 - Additional Complexity

- Extend the program to allow users to rate movies. Implement a function to overwrite the score of a specific movie.
- Create a function to recommend a movie based on the user's preferred genre and the highest score in that genre.

### Task 5 - Chart Creation

- Implement a function to create a chart visually representing movie score distribution. You can choose any appropriate chart type (e.g., bar chart, histogram).

### Submission Guidelines

- Set up a private GitHub repo for your project and add "almaeconomics" as a collaborator.
- Aim to send in your work within the next five days.
